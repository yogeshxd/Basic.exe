# Basic.exe
The main idea behind this repository is to provide some simple yet lethal programmes that can do various things.

Detailed description is as follows :

1. Grabby - Collects all wifi passwords stored in any win10 system and provides the output in plain text file.
2. Snatch - Collects search history, login data and cookies from chrome browser giving output in non extension files (use .db extension to make it readable).
3. Keylog - A simple key logger that can capture every key you press on your keyboard.
4. More to come soon...
