The main idea behind this repository is to provide some simple yet lethal programmes that can do various things.

Detailed description is as follows :

1. Grabby - Collects all wifi passwords stored in any win10 system and provides the output in plain text file.
2. Snatch - Collects search history, login data and cookies from chrome browser giving out in a non extension file(use .db extension to make it readable).
3. More coming soon...

Follow & dm me on [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/yogesh_.xd/) for any doubts.
Also have code that can mail you the output files. Contact for that.
